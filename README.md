📌 K-Means Clustering – Mall Customer Segmentation

This project applies K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to perform customer segmentation using the Mall Customers dataset. The goal is to group customers into clusters based on their purchasing behavior and characteristics, allowing businesses to target specific customer groups more effectively.
🔍 What the Project Does
Loads and explores the Mall Customers dataset
Uses customer attributes such as:
Age
Annual Income
Spending Score
Applies the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
Uses K-Means Clustering to segment customers into meaningful groups
Visualizes clusters using scatter plots for better understanding
Helps identify patterns such as:
High-income, high-spending customers
Low-income, low-spending customers
Budget customers
Pzemium customers
🎯 Why K-Means?
K-Means is widely used for customer segmentation because:
It’s simple and efficient
Works well with large datasets
Creates clear and distinct customer clusters
Helps companies personalize marketing strategies
📊 Outcome
By the end of the project, we obtain well-separated customer clusters that can be used for:
Targeted marketing
Customer behavior analysis
Business decision-making
